﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿# DescriptionGrapher is a java library similar to pyplot in python, which can display functions or points on screen. The Grapher is still in development phase and only support some fundmental functions, more will be added in the future.# Features- Calculations: Grapher can read expressions in string format and calculate its result- Function graph: Customize your own function graph- Points graph: Display discrete points on screen, or choose to link them together# How to useSee `demo` for more examples# TODO- [x] Regression Model- [ ] Histogram# Example graphs![alt text](https://github.com/NielXu/Grapher/blob/master/resources/Functions.jpg "Single function")![alt text](https://github.com/NielXu/Grapher/blob/master/resources/MultipleFunctions.jpg "Multiple  functions on the same graph")![alt text](https://github.com/NielXu/Grapher/blob/master/resources/RandomPoints.jpg "Random points")![alt text](https://github.com/NielXu/Grapher/blob/master/resources/LinkedPoints.jpg "Linked points")![alt text](https://github.com/NielXu/Grapher/blob/master/resources/histogram.jpg "Histogram")
